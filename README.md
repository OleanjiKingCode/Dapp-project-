# Dapp-project-

After making some tokens and some tutorial project I would make
a series of project revolving around DEDI
Decentralized Digital Identification 
To identify humans apart from bots
A key is generated for every human that applies and
This key is used to enter and authenticates them for the other dapps
Like voting dapp, personal diary app, marketplaces all using a deflationary token
.
More on the other dapps later
1) would be voting dapp
Next repo
